// here we had to count the total number of characters present between two "a", 
// and if more than two "a" are present than we had to find the minimum total 
// count of substring between two "a", both "a" will also be included.if less than two "a"
// are present than print -1;

let str = abcad; //ans = 4;
// let str =  abcabdaadg  ans = 2;
// let str = algh ans = -1  // qki "a" do bar ni aaya h


// solution
